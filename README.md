# HTS4VC
HTS4VC is a vulnerability classification method based on knowledge distillation.

Our implementation is based on Vulexplainer. If you use this code, please cite "M. Fu, V. Nguyen, C. K. Tantithamthavorn, T. Le and D. Phung, "VulExplainer: A Transformer-Based Hierarchical Distillation for Explaining Vulnerability Types," in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, vol. 49, no. 10, pp. 4550-4565."
